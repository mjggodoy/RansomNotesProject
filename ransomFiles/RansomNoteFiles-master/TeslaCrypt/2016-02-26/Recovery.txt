What happened to your files ?
All of your files were protected by a strong encryption with AES 
More information about the encryption keys using AES can be found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES

How did this happen ?
!!! Specially for your PC was generated personal AES KEY, both public and private.

<p class="bodytext" id="title"><i class="fa fa-optin-monster fa-3x" aria-hidden="true"></i><br>BadBlock is on the block!<br></p><div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="bodytext">&nbsp;
This machine was infected with ransomware BadBlock. Many of your files
are encrypted using RSA algorithm, and the key to decrypt this files is
with us on our server.</span> <br><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="bodytext">&nbsp; -What this means?</span><br class="bodytext"><span class="bodytext">It
means that to decrypt and recover your files, you will need to pay a
ransom, in bitcoins. The actual ransom for your machine is 2 bitcoins
(USD ~900.00)</span>.&nbsp;<br><span class="bodytext">If you are not
interested in pay this ransom, you can easily format this machine, or
even remove BadBlock (it's not that hard), but all your files will
become unrecoverable!</span><br><br><span class="bodytext">&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">-How do I pay?</span></span><br class="bodytext"><span class="bodytext">You simply buy bitcoins, and transfer them to this account: <span id="account">19zvMSm7qSQgFXCckXBjstdVdbT99ZuWBP</span></span><br class="bodytext"><span class="bodytext">The amount is 2 bitcoins, like we talked earlier... You can use </span><a class="bodytext" href="https://coincafe.com/">this link</a><span class="bodytext"> or <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/information/how-can-i-buy-bitcoins/">this link</a> to help you out on how to buy the bitcoins.</span><br><br>&nbsp; <span class="bodytext" style="font-weight: bold;">-What happens after the payment?</span><br><span class="bodytext">BadBlock
still running on your computer right now, and waiting to detect one
payment of 2 BTC on the address mentioned above. Once it detects, it
will start to decrypt all the encrypted files.</span> <span class="bodytext">The
process to detect the payment can take up to 2 hours, and only after
this it will start decrypting your files. So after payment, leave this
machine powered.</span><br class="bodytext"><span class="bodytext">For
this reason, we strongly recommend you to not try to remove BadBlock,
and disable your anti-virus for a while, until you pay and the payment
gets processed, to BadBlock start decrypting. If your anti-virus gets
updated and remove BadBlock automatically, even if you pay the ransom,
it will not be able to recover your files!</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="bodytext">&nbsp;-How do I know that you will really decrypt my files after payment?</span><br class="bodytext"><span class="bodytext">You
don't. You have only one choice to recover your files: pay the ransom.
We have no interest in keeping your files locked for any reason. So
right now, just rely on us and everything will be fine. </span></div>

What exactly happend?
All your Videos, Music, Documents and other files are no longer accessible. I'm sorry to tell you, that there's no way to decrypt your files from this time. Wasting your time is currently no good behaviour!

How to get your files back?
Now you're asking yourself how much Bitcoins you have to send to get your files back, well.. None. You simply can't get your files back!

I see that you're surprised. But let's be honest. Others are just fake. You send the money.. you get nothing.
I spare you time!

But I'm a good human being!
I don't care what you are. I have nothing against you! It's not just you, it's everyone!


Then what's the matter with the countdown?
Well.. actually there might be a little chance to decrypt your files. But even I don't know how to decrypt something without a key and when the timer runs out, all of your files will be corrupted forever!

And by the way, closing this program won't help you. All files will be corrupted immediately!
